let's say that i wanna implement a web app provided for cosplayers, which are divided into 4 main users: shop owners, shop co-owner, cooperator (only bound by shop owners) and normal users (whose purpose is about to rent outfits,wigs or buy anything else)
there is only 1 owner for each shop, and there will be unlimited cooperators (shop owner can add into their shop)
the identity of each user can be bound with an external identity provider (optional) and only logs in via that provider to prevent scamming
the detail of the shop can show off the adress, phone number of owner (both only shows if user drag the mouse into the corresponding field)
if the item is a cosplay outfit: includes set name (corresponding to character), brand, size, price (for 3 purposes: testing, shooting, participating festival) in VND, feedbacks (up to 10 from customers, may include message, can include up to 5 images per feedback), and source link (for the original post)
each outfit can be categorized by gender and which game/anime series does it belong to
requirements:
- php for database interaction
- js for main frames
- default will turn redirect to "/home"
